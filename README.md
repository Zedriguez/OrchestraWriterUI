# Orchestra Visualizer

**Team:** Megala Sivasankar · Lucas Sasaya · Valiantsin (Val) Kasabrukhau ·
Xuerui (Sherry) He · Zehavi Rodriguez · Stella Wang

A web app that shows which parts of an orchestra are playing, and how loud the
score says they are, while a recording plays. You upload a MusicXML score and,
if you have one, an MP3 of a performance. The app lines the score up with the
recording, lights up each part on a labeled orchestra seating plan, and lets
you export the result as a project file or an MP4 with audio.

The rule behind the display: **the light shows the written dynamic in the
score, not the loudness of the recording.** Brightness is the dynamic (pp to
fff) and color is the section (strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion). We built
it for listeners who don't read scores, so they can follow a symphony, and for
musicians who need to learn quickly who plays what before a rehearsal.

The workflow is **Import → Sync → Customize → Preview → Export**. Sync only
appears when you upload a recording; without one, the app plays audio it
synthesizes from the score.

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the specification and architecture, and
[MS1-PROGRESS.md](MS1-PROGRESS.md) for the Milestone 1 report.

## Set up

Requirements: Node.js 20+, npm, and Docker (for Postgres and a local S3).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vkasabrukhau/OrchestraWriterUI.git
cd OrchestraWriterUI
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # only needed for the end-to-end tests
```

You don't need a `.env` file to run locally, because every setting has a local
default. `.env.example` lists the variables used in production.

## Run

```bash
docker compose up -d      # Postgres 17 on localhost:5433, S3Mock on localhost:9090
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000 (database migrations run on boot)
```

1. Sign up with any email and a password of 8 or more characters.
2. Click **New project** and drop `fixtures/scores/orchestra-demo.musicxml`.
   To try the Sync step, also drop `fixtures/audio/orchestra-demo.mp3`.
3. Step through Sync, Customize and Preview, then export a `.ovproj` project
   file or an MP4 from the Export page.

MP4 export uses WebCodecs, so use Chrome or Edge. Firefox exports video
without audio, and we haven't tested Safari yet.

To try the UI without Docker, run `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCK=1 npm run dev`. The
front end then uses an in-memory mock API.

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` | accounts (email and password; Google when configured) |
| `/library`, `/programs`, `/profile`, `/settings` | the user's home |
| `/projects/<id>/import` → `sync` → `customize` → `preview` → `export` | the workflow |

Keyboard shortcuts on any playback screen: `Space` play/pause, `←`/`→` skip
5 s (`Shift` for 30 s), `M` mute, `Home` jump to the start.

## Test

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck     # next typegen + tsc --noEmit
npm test              # unit and component tests (Vitest)
npm run test:api      # API integration tests; needs `docker compose up -d`
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright end-to-end tests in Chromium; starts the dev server
npm run build         # production build
```

On every pull request, CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck,
and the unit, API and end-to-end tests.

## Project layout

- `src/app/`: Next.js routes, split into the `(auth)`, `(app)` and
  `(workflow)` groups, plus `api/[[...route]]`, where the server is mounted.
- `src/server/`: the HTTP API (Hono, Better Auth, Postgres, S3). See
  `docs/backend/README.md` and `docs/backend/API.md`.
- `src/shared/`: code and types shared by server and browser, including the
  MusicXML parser, the information map, the project file, sync and API types.
- `src/lib/`: browser logic, including the API client, stores, alignment
  worker, audio engines, MP4 export and the visualizer.
- `src/components/`: UI components, with one folder per screen and the shared
  primitives in `ui/`.
- `tests/`: unit, API and end-to-end tests. Test inputs are in `fixtures/`.
- `docs/`: the spec, design decisions (`decisions/`), plans, research and
  handoff notes.

## Deploying

When code is pushed to `main`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the Docker
image and deploys it to AWS App Runner. Before the first deploy, someone has to
run `scripts/deploy-init.sh` once.
