# Orchestra Visualizer

Shows which parts of an orchestra are playing, and how loud the score says
they are, while a recording plays. Brightness = written dynamic, color =
section. Upload a MusicXML score and an optional MP3, check the sync, set up
the display, preview, export a project file or an MP4.

One Next.js app: the pages, and the API (Hono + Better Auth + Postgres + S3)
mounted at `/api`. Score parsing runs on the server; alignment and MP4 export
run in the browser. See `docs/decisions/` for the why.

## Run

```bash
npm install
docker compose up -d      # Postgres on localhost:5433, S3Mock on localhost:9090
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000 (migrations run on boot)
```

No `.env` is needed locally; `.env.example` lists every variable for
production. Sign up with any email and password (8+ characters), then
**New project** → drop `fixtures/scores/orchestra-demo.musicxml` and, if you
want the Sync step, `fixtures/audio/orchestra-demo.mp3`.

Design review without a backend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCK=1 npm run dev`.

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` | accounts (email + password, Google when configured) |
| `/library`, `/programs`, `/profile`, `/settings` | the director's home |
| `/projects/<id>/import` → `sync` → `customize` → `preview` → `export` | the workflow; Sync only with a recording |

Keyboard on any playback screen: `Space` play/pause, `←`/`→` 5 s (`Shift` 30 s), `M` mute, `Home` start.

## Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test              # unit + component tests
npm run test:api      # API integration tests (needs docker compose)
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright, Chromium
npm run build
```

## Where things are

- `src/server/` — the API; `docs/backend/README.md` and `API.md`.
- `src/shared/` — contracts shared by server and browser (info map, project file, sync, API DTOs, MusicXML parser).
- `src/lib/` — api client, auth, stores, jobs, align, audio, export, visualizer.
- `src/components/` — `ui` primitives (Radix), `music`, `visualizer`, one folder per screen.
- `docs/` — spec, decisions (ADRs), plan, research, handoffs. `CLAUDE.md` holds the working rules.
- `fixtures/` — demo score and recording, parser quirk fixtures (`npm run fixtures` regenerates the generated ones).

## Deploying

Push to `main`: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the Docker image and
rolls it out on AWS App Runner (one-time setup: `scripts/deploy-init.sh`).
`ci.yml` runs lint, typecheck, unit, API and e2e tests on every pull request.
